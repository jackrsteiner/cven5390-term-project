## Design

### User-centered
Exercising user-centered design principles and processes, I created 4 personas representing different intended users for the web map. Each persona is also associated with several user stories, or how a user might want to utilize the application. [link](./user-centered.md)


### Mock-up
A quick sketch demonstrating the intended user interface and briefly describing functions.
