# Mapping Public Infrastructure for Emergency Management in the Federated States of Micronesia

## Introduction
A Term Project for CVEN5390, Interactive Web Mapping, at the University of Colorado Denver completed for Fall 2022.

## Proposal
Available as a [pdf](./CVEN%205390%20-%20Term%20Project%20Pitch.pdf) or [natively in the browser](./proposal.md).

## Design

### User-centered design [ðŸ”—](./user-centered.md)
Exercising user-centered design principles and processes, I created 4 personas representing different intended users for the web map. Each persona is also associated with several user stories, or how a user might want to utilize the application.

### Mock-up
A quick sketch demonstrating the intended user interface and briefly describing functions.
